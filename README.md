### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Andrew.

Business Analyst turned Data Scientist, I am interested in machine learning operations and unstuctured data processing, such as texts and images. Join me as I explore the nooks and crannies of data science from data engineering to model deployment on cloud services like AWS.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on two projects: one classifier with textual data and one regression with geographical coordinates.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning operations (ex: self training pipelines) 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about data preprocessing, web-scraping, data visualization, machine learning, cloud deployment
